Get your offer More about payments EPOS FAQs Does RST EPOS work for both hospitality and retail? Yes. Configure workflows for bars, restaurants and cafés, or switch to retail features like barcode scanning, SKUs and quick keys. You can mix setups across sites. Are card payments integrated? Yes. With TapaPay and supported terminals, the bill is sent from EPOS to the reader—contactless, tips and refunds in seconds, with fewer keying errors. Can I manage multiple locations? Yes. Tapa Office provides centralised menus, price lists and live dashboards across sites, plus scheduled KPI emails for managers. What about stock control and kitchen printing/screens? Enable stock with deliveries, recipes and wastage tracking. In hospitality, send courses to kitchen printers or screens with clear modifiers and notes. Does it work offline? Core POS continues if the connection drops and syncs when it returns. Card authorisation depends on your payments setup. How long does setup take? Typical rollouts are fast—import products/menus, configure printers and payments, and train staff. Timelines vary by sites and hardware. ×
