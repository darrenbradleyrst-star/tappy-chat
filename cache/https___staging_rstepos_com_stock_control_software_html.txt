It syncs in real time with TapaPOS so your stock levels, costs, and margins stay accurate across every site. How does Stock Control connect to my tills? Tapa Office reads sales and product data live from TapaPOS. Every sale, void, or refund adjusts stock automatically, so counts and cost of goods reflect what actually happened on the tills and online. Can I create purchase orders and receive deliveries? Yes — generate supplier orders from par levels or usage, then receive deliveries against those orders. Cost prices update automatically and any discrepancies are highlighted for review. Does it support transfers, returns, and waste? Absolutely. Record transfers between sites or stock locations, process supplier returns, and log waste. All movements are tracked with user, date, time, and reason codes for a clear audit trail. How do stock takes work — can I use a handheld? You can perform full or partial stock takes by area, category, or item. Use handheld scanners or mobile sheets to speed up counting, then reconcile expected vs actual with variance/period and spot checking reports. Can I link recipes to products for automatic depletions? Yes. Link ingredients to menu items and Tapa Office will deduct usage automatically when items sell, keeping recipe costs and GP accurate even when prices change.
