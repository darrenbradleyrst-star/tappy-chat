Skip to content What are cookies? Cookies are small text files placed on your device by websites you visit. They are widely used to make websites work, keep them secure, remember your preferences, and understand how a site is used. We also use related technologies such as local storage and pixels; we refer to all of these collectively as “cookies”. How we use cookies We use cookies in the following categories. Necessary cookies are always on; all others are used only if you give consent via our banner or settings. Necessary – required for core site functions like page navigation, security, and network management. Analytics – help us understand site usage (e.g. page views, events) so we can improve performance and content. Advertising – enable ad storage and measurement, including remarketing and conversion tracking. Personalisation – allow us or our partners to show more relevant content or ads based on your activity. Your consent & control On your first visit we set all non-essential categories to “off”. If you choose Accept all, we’ll enable analytics, advertising and personalisation cookies. If you choose Reject all, we’ll keep only necessary cookies. You can revisit your choices at any time. We implement Google Consent Mode v2, which respects your selections by signalling your status for analytics and ads storage, ad user data and personalisation. Some services may operate in a restricted mode until consent is granted.

Third-party embeds (e.g. YouTube “nocookie” or Vimeo) may set additional cookies only if you interact with the content. Legal basis & transfers For the UK and EEA, we use necessary cookies under our legitimate interests to operate the site. For analytics, advertising and personalisation we rely on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time via the controls above. Data may be processed by providers in the UK, EU, or outside the EEA under appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses. Managing cookies in your browser You can also block or delete cookies using your browser settings. Doing so may affect site functionality.
