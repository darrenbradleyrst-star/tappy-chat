Integrations Restaurant EPOS – FAQs What is EPOS and how is it different from a traditional till? EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) combines fast checkout with live reporting, stock control, and integrated card payments. Unlike a traditional till, RST EPOS connects front-of-house, kitchen, and back office so orders flow instantly and you can see performance in real time. Does RST EPOS work if the internet drops? Yes. Core EPOS functions continue offline and sync automatically when the connection returns, so you can keep serving during busy periods. Card payments depend on the terminal/provider configuration. Do you offer integrated card payments? We do. Our TapaPay integration sends the bill straight to the card reader, reduces keying errors, and speeds up checkout. You can also connect leading UK payment providers—talk to us about rates. What hardware do I need? Most sites use a touchscreen EPOS terminal, printer, cash drawer and card reader. You can add kitchen displays, handheld waiter devices, and tablets for at-table ordering as you grow. How much does it cost? Packages are tailored by outlet size and modules (e.g., reservations, online ordering, gift vouchers). We’ll give you a clear monthly or upfront quote—no hidden fees. See pricing or book a demo. Can I keep my existing card provider? Often, yes. We integrate with multiple acquirers and terminals. If we can lower your fees with TapaPay, we’ll show the numbers so you can decide. Do you integrate with hotel PMS and reservations? Yes—RST EPOS integrates with leading PMS and reservations platforms (e.g., Protel, Guestline, MEWS, ResDiary). Ask us about your current stack. What onboarding and support do you provide? We handle menu build, staff training, and go-live support. Ongoing UK support is available 7 days with remote diagnostics and optional on-site cover.
